## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive and user-friendly booking flow.  
- Maintain visual consistency across all pages.  
- Ensure fast loading times and performance optimization.  
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness and accessibility.  

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering options.  
- Detailed property viewing with image carousel.  
- Secure checkout and booking confirmation process.  
- User authentication and profile management.  

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid of available properties with search and filter functionality. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows complete property details, including images, host information, and a booking form. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Provides a streamlined booking confirmation and secure payment process. |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking platform minimizes user friction, improves the overall experience, and drives conversion. User-friendly navigation, responsive layouts, and intuitive interfaces are essential in helping users find and book properties efficiently, leading to higher satisfaction and trust.
